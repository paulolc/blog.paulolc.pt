If you throw a party and you want to conveniently share your guest wifi network details with your guests just create a QR code with the wifi configuration. You could also do this if you own a public place with free-wifi and spare your customers/visitors of the hassle of configuring the wifi. The QR code would do it for them.

It's easy. Just use your favorite QR code generator with a crafted string having the following pattern:

`WIFI:T:WPA;S:mynetwork;P:mypass;;`


| Parameter | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| T | WPA | Authentication type; can be WEP or WPA, or 'nopass' for no password. Or, omit for no password. |
| S | mynetwork | Network SSID. Required. Enclose in double quotes if it is an ASCII name, but could be interpreted as hex (i.e. "ABCD")
 |
| P | mypass | Password, ignored if T is "nopass" (in which case it may be omitted). Enclose in double quotes if it is an ASCII name, but could be interpreted as hex (i.e. "ABCD")
 |
| H | true |Optional. True if the network SSID is hidden.
