The Art of Computer Programming is a set of books by Donald Knuth, a notable computer scientist.

I bought TAOCP basically because of Donald Knuth. I've watched multiple very interesting talks by him. His ideas and approach are truly unique and interesting. A true guru. However, in true honesty, when I decided to buy this book I was not expecting to learn anything immediately useful and with practical application in my day-to-day job of requirement analsysis and software design. Just by the titles of the book collection (chapters?) it was evident that the technologies I use in the software that I'm helping to build are not even mentioned in this book. Well, in fact, they are, but not at a level that I need to reason or even to think about them. That is, the books are about fundamental algorithms and algorithms analysis. Things like searching, sorting and combinatorial algorithms are part of the fabric of all the software that we use, but to build software to satisfy some business requirements you basically just "layering bricks", the building blocks of software engineering.

Soon after start reading the book, I
